# Try to correct the spelling of commands. Note that, when the HASH_LIST_ALL option is not set or when some directories in the path are not readable,
# this may falsely report spelling errors the first time some commands are used.
# The shell variable CORRECT_IGNORE may be set to a pattern to match words that will never be offered as corrections.
setopt CORRECT

# Try to correct the spelling of all arguments in a line.
# The shell variable CORRECT_IGNORE_FILE may be set to a pattern to match file names that will never be offered as corrections.
#setopt CORRECT_ALL

# Whenever a command completion or spelling correction is attempted, make sure the entire command path is hashed first. 
# This makes the first completion slower but avoids false reports of spelling errors.
